# Lobster: Vision & Value Proposition

## One-liner

**Lobster is safe automation for Clawdbot — workflows that ask before acting.**

---

## What is Lobster?

Lobster is a workflow runtime for Clawdbot. It lets you define multi-step automations that:

- Run deterministically (no LLM re-planning each step)
- Halt at checkpoints and ask for approval before side effects
- Resume exactly where they left off
- Remember what they've already processed

Think of it as **IFTTT/Zapier for Clawdbot, but with human checkpoints**.

---

## The Problem Lobster Solves

### Today's workflow in Clawdbot

```
User: "Check my email, draft replies to anything urgent, and send them"

What happens:
1. LLM plans: "I should search emails first"
2. Tool call: gmail.search
3. LLM interprets results, plans next step
4. Tool call: gmail.get (for each email)
5. LLM drafts replies
6. LLM decides to send
7. Tool call: gmail.send
... repeat for each email
```

**Problems:**
- Many tool calls = many tokens = expensive
- LLM decides when to send = risky (what if it misunderstands?)
- No memory = tomorrow it re-triages the same emails
- Not repeatable = you can't save this as an automation

### With Lobster

```
Clawdbot calls: lobster.run("email.triage")

What happens:
1. Lobster fetches emails (deterministic)
2. Lobster classifies them (rule-based)
3. Lobster drafts replies (optional LLM step)
4. Lobster HALTS: "Send 3 drafts? [approve/reject]"
5. User approves
6. Lobster sends

Tomorrow: Lobster remembers cursor, only processes new emails
```

**One call. Deterministic. Safe. Stateful.**

## Why Lobster Makes Clawdbot Better

| Without Lobster | With Lobster |
|-----------------|--------------|
| LLM orchestrates every step | Deterministic pipeline, LLM only for judgment |
| 10+ tool calls per workflow | 1 call to Lobster |
| "Don't send until I confirm" (hope it listens) | `approve` halts execution until explicit resume |
| Forgets what it did yesterday | Stateful — tracks cursors/checkpoints |
| Hard to share automations | Workflows are code — shareable, versionable |

### Token savings (real)
A 10-step workflow today might cost 10 tool calls × LLM planning overhead.
With Lobster: 1 tool call + compact structured output.

### Safety (the killer feature)
The `approve` primitive isn't a prompt hint — it's a **hard stop**. The workflow literally cannot continue until you resume it. No "oops, it sent 50 emails."

### Memory (underrated)
Workflows can persist state: "last processed email ID", "last PR SHA seen", etc. Tomorrow's run picks up where yesterday left off.

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key insight:** Lobster doesn't replace Clawdbot. It's the execution layer that makes Clawdbot's automations safe and efficient.

- **Clawdbot** = the brain (understands what you want)
- **Lobster** = the hands (executes workflows safely)
- **Tools/Skills** = the capabilities (gmail, trello, github, etc.)

---

## Who Should Use Lobster?

### Average Clawdbot users (invisible benefit)
They don't need to know Lobster exists. They just notice:
- "Set up daily email triage" works better
- Automations ask before sending/posting
- Things don't get re-processed every day

### Power users / tinkerers
They can:
- Customize workflows ("I want triage to also create Trello cards")
- Write new workflows for their specific needs
- Share workflows with the community

### The Clawdbot ecosystem
- Workflow recipes become a new category of shareable assets
- Skills stay simple (just expose APIs)
- Lobster handles the orchestration layer

## Analogies That Work

| If you know... | Lobster is like... |
|----------------|-------------------|
| IFTTT/Zapier | Multi-step version with approval checkpoints |
| GitHub Actions | But for personal automation, not CI/CD |
| AWS Step Functions | But local-first and human-in-the-loop |
| Unix pipes | But for JSON objects, not text bytes |
| Temporal | But 80/20 version for personal workflows |

**Best analogy for most people:**
> "Lobster is Zapier for Clawdbot, except it asks you before doing anything irreversible."

---

## Why Not Build This Into Clawdbot Core?

It could be. But the plugin architecture is intentional:

1. **Core stays small** — Clawdbot is already complex
2. **Faster iteration** — Lobster can evolve without core releases
3. **Opt-in** — Not everyone needs workflow automation
4. **Community** — Easier to contribute workflows than core changes
5. **Ecosystem proof** — If plugins work for Lobster, they work for other capabilities

Pete (Clawdbot creator) explicitly built the plugin boundary to enable this pattern. Lobster is the first proof that it works.

## Example Workflows

### Email triage (flagship)
```
gog.gmail.search --query "newer_than:1d" 
  | email.normalize 
  | email.classify 
  | where bucket==needs_reply 
  | draft.reply 
  | approve --prompt "Send N replies?" 
  | gog.gmail.send
```

### PR monitor
```
github.pr.get --repo org/repo --pr 123
  | diff.last
  | where changed==true
  | notify --channel telegram --message "PR updated: {summary}"
```

### Daily planning
```
calendar.today
  | join tasks.today
  | prioritize
  | format.plan
  | approve --prompt "Post to #daily?"
  | message.send --channel slack --to "#daily"
```

### Inbox → Trello
```
email.triage
  | where bucket==needs_action
  | to.trelloCard
  | approve --prompt "Create N cards?"
  | trello.card.create --list "Inbox"
```

## The USP (Unique Selling Proposition)

**"Automations that ask before acting."**

Other automation tools either:
- Run blindly (IFTTT, Zapier) — scary for important actions
- Require complex configuration for approvals
- Don't integrate with your AI assistant

Lobster is:
- Native to Clawdbot (uses the same tools you already have)
- Safe by default (approvals are a language primitive)
- Invisible when you want (Clawdbot uses it automatically)
- Customizable when you need (write your own workflows)

---

## What Lobster Is NOT

- **Not a terminal replacement** — You don't switch your shell to Lobster
- **Not a general programming language** — It's for workflows, not apps
- **Not trying to replace Clawdbot** — It makes Clawdbot better
- **Not managing your secrets** — Clawdbot handles auth, Lobster orchestrates

## Summary

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| What is it? | Workflow runtime for Clawdbot |
| One-liner? | Safe automation — workflows that ask before acting |
| Why use it? | Cheaper, safer, stateful automations |
| Who uses it? | Everyone (invisibly) or power users (directly) |
